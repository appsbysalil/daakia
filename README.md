## Change log v2.0.4

## ðŸš€ Enhancements

### ðŸ”§ Debug & Script Logging
- `DataContext` now **loads persisted debug settings** and **automatically starts log capture**, ensuring continuity across sessions.
- `UIContext` updates and persists user choices for:
    - Debug mode
    - Script logging
      ...into `DaakiaSettings`.

- `DaakiaSettingsState` now includes new fields for storing debug preferences.

- **About Dialog** now:
    - Remembers the Script/GraalVM checkbox state.
    - Toggles debug mode based on the checkbox.

### ðŸ§µ UI & Tab Handling
- Debug tab creation now executes on the **Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)**, showing captured logs immediately.
- Tabs for **Environment**, **History**, and **Collection items** are now created directly on the **Swing thread**, ensuring they always appear without checking the current thread.
- Updated `DaakiaTabbedMainPanel` to create tabs via `ApplicationManager.invokeLater` for thread-safe rendering.
